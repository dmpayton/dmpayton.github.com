## An unofficial Android player for KUSC

KUSC is a listener-supported classical radio station by the University of Southern California. Learn more at [KUSC.org](http://www.kusc.org).

I currently live just outside of KUSC's broadcast area, and I wanted a way to tune in when not at my computer. This is my first Android app, developed during several evenings and a couple weekends of hacking.

The official KUSC Android app is currently in developement, and I will no longer support this app when it it released. It is unlikely that this app will be placed on the Android Marketplace. **This app is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by KUSC.**
