Title: Setup

## Tools

My primary machine is a [Dell XPS](http://www.frys.com/product/6661324) laptop that I picked up from Fry's. I run [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) with [Qtile](http://qtile.org/), a tiling window manager written in Python.

Most of my programming is done with [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) because I like having an editor with the same interface regardless of what operating system I happen to be using at the time.

I'm a big fan of Google and use a lot of their products, including [Chrome](http://google.com/chrome), [Gmail](http://gmail.com/), and [Reader](http://google.com/reader), and [Docs](http://docs.google.com/).
