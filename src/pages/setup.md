Title: Setup

## Tools

My primary machine is a [Dell XPS](http://www.frys.com/product/6661324) laptop that I picked up from my local Fry's. I run [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) with [Qtile](http://qtile.org/) which allows me to have much greater control over computer.

Most of my programming is done with [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) because I like having an editor with the same interface whether I'm on my laptop or at work on my Mac.

I'm a big fan of Google and use a lot of their products, including [Chrome](http://google.com/chrome), [Gmail](http://gmail.com/), and [Reader](http://google.com/reader), and [Docs](http://docs.google.com/).
