Title: About

I am a 25 year-old software developer who specializes in web application development using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). I have worked at all levels of the web stack, including front-end and back-end development, and system administration.

I always strive to write clean, maintainable code, and I follow standards, best practices, and common idioms where applicable. My primary technical interests revolve around web application architecture and scalability.

I'm a California native, and I currently live in [Fresno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California) with my wife and daughter. I work full-time at [Edit, LLC](http://montagable.com/), part-time at [Web Cube CMS](http://www.webcubecms.com/), and spare-time on [other endeavors of the heart](http://github.com/dmpayton).
