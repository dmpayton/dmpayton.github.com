Pelican Powered

:intro: This site is now Pelican Powered

So, I've hopped on the bandwagon and migrated my site to `Pelican`_ & `Github`_.

The great thing is that my previous posts -- all three of them -- were written in `Markdown`_, so migrating was a snap. Over the past few weeks I've developed a taste for `reStructured Text`_, thanks to `Sphinx`_, so I'll probably be using that from here on out.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still a big fan of Heroku and will continue to use it for my future Django sites. However I think that Django + Heroku + S3 was a tad overkill for my needs and a statically generated site is a better fit.
