Thanks to [Tarek Ziade](http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/new-years-python-meme-2/) for kicking off this meme. It's neat to see people list out what they did in the old year and their plans for the new one.

**1. What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2011?**

[Qtile](http://qtile.org), although I technically discovered it sometime in 2010. I initially ran into installation issues and gave up, but Matt Harrison's excellent [PyCon 2011 Qtile Lightning Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_8om4dsEmw) gave me the motivation to give it another go, and I've been using it since.

I also have to mention [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), which I recently started deploying Django sites on. Although I've run into a couple issues, it's been really nice to work with overall. I think it's going to be my preferred deployment platform from now on.

**2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2011?**

Unit testing. I wrote more -- though not enough by far -- tests this year. I definitely see the value of testing to prove that the code works, but I'm still not sold on TDD.

Not really a programming technique, but I'm pretty stoked that I put my first packages onto PyPI this year (opposed to just throwing them up onto Github).

**3. What’s the name of the open source project you contributed the most in 2011? What did you do?**

Most of my open source contributions were through my own [projects](http://dmpayton.com/projects/) (everything on that page was released in 2011). I also made small contributions to [Qtile](http://qtile.org), [django-reportengine](https://github.com/cuker/django-reportengine), and [django-activitysync](https://bitbucket.org/dancarroll/django-activitysync).

**4. What was the Python blog or website you read the most in 2011?**

Everyone mentions [Planet Python](http://planet.python.org), which holds true for me as well. [Django Community](https://www.djangoproject.com/community/) also adds a lot to my reader, and I spent a bit of time lurking in [r/Python](http://www.reddit.com/r/python) and [r/Django](http://www.reddit.com/r/django).

**5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2012?**

1. [Redis](http://redis.io/) -- I've toyed around with it, but I want to use it for something serious.
2. [CraftyJS](http://craftyjs.com/) -- I've always wanted to try my hand at game development, and this looks like it could be fun.
3. [Android](http://www.android.com/) -- I built [my first Android app](http://dmpayton.com/projects/kusc-android/) this year, and I'd like to do more.

**6. What are the top software, app or lib you wish someone would write in 2012?**

[Glyph Lefkowitz](http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/) gave this years *Why I Hate Django* talk at DjangoCon (you should watch it, [it's most excellent](http://blip.tv/djangocon/keynote-glyph-lefkowitz-5573264)). He argues that Python should be a bigger part of your infrastructure (even in places where it may not be the best solution) for a more cohesive architectural design.

In the same vein, I want to see a dead-simple continuous integration server with git/hg/svn support and nice Github/Bitbucket integration. Essentially something like [Integrity](http://integrityapp.com/), but in Python and I want it to catch on in the community.

(I realize that CI servers built in Python exist, but I haven't found one that meets all my requirements.)
